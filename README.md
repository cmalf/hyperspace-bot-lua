# üí´ hyperspace-bot-lua
Simplifying Hyperspace CLI usage with a robust LUA bot, making commands easier to execute and manage.

> [!WARNING]
> Due to the large number of participants,and the server capacity has not been increased.
> You will often encounter errors from the server such as 500,502,503 (meaning the server is overloaded).

> [!TIP]
> If you're just focused on increasing uptime and collecting points, for now it's better to just run a node.
